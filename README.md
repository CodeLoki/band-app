# Band App

A band management application for organizing songs, gigs, and setlists. Built for musicians to manage their repertoire, plan performances, and generate PDF setlists.

## Features

- 🎵 **Song Management** - Organize your band's song library with details like artist, tempo, groove patterns, and practice notes
- 🎸 **Multi-Instrument Support** - Track who starts each song, featured instruments, and solo order
- 📅 **Gig Planning** - Schedule gigs with venue information and date tracking
- 📋 **Setlist Builder** - Create setlists with Set One, Set Two, and Pocket (backup) songs
- 📄 **PDF Export** - Generate printable setlists for your gigs
- 👥 **Multi-Band Support** - Manage multiple bands from a single account
- 🔐 **Role-Based Access** - Different views for drummers, vocalists, guitarists, and sound engineers

## User Roles

The app supports different user roles, each with a tailored experience when viewing and interacting with songs.

### Available Users

| User | Song Card Click Action | Song Card Notes |
|------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Vocals** | Opens Genius lyrics search | Shows who starts the song |
| **Guitars** | Opens Ultimate Guitar tab search | Shows who starts the song |
| **Mixer** | Opens YouTube Music video | Shows who starts, featured instruments, and solo order |

### How It Works

When a user clicks on a song card, the app opens the appropriate external resource based on their role:

- **Vocals** - Searches [Genius](https://genius.com) for lyrics to help with memorization and performance
- **Guitars** - Searches [Ultimate Guitar](https://ultimate-guitar.com) for chord charts and tabs
- **Mixer** - Opens the song on [YouTube Music](https://youtube.com) for audio reference during sound check

The song card also displays role-specific information:
- All users see who starts each song (drums, bass, guitar, etc.)
- Mixers additionally see featured instruments and the solo order to help with live mixing
